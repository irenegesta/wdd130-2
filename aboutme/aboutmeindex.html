    <p>Hello everyone. Let me introduce myself. I am a student of Bachelor of Science
    major in Computer Engineering at Surigao Norte State University. I am from Surigao City, Philippines.
    It is a nice place for island adventures. I love watching anime like One Piece. I served in Philippines Davao Mission 
    from April 2019 to November 2020. I continually enjoy serving the Lord as an adult leader first counselor in young women 
    organization and a seminary teacher in our branch.</p>
    <p>I take Web and Computer Programming or Applied Technology because I find it really interesting and I would like to find a new skill.
     I love BYU-Idaho because you can meet different people of the same faith. I am looking forward to learn and work with you all. Thank you.</p>
     <p>This is week 2</p>
